I made a design for a travel blog style website and wanted to experiment with animating video elements to see how possible it was and what the performance limitations were. Turns out you can play and animate multiple videos in tandem and still get good performance. There are sometimes issues with one video not playing or the videos being slightly out of sync which I wasn’t able to debug, also the videos aren’t encoded to work in Safari so sorry about that!
